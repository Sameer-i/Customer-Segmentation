Customer segmentation helps a firm to segment its customers into different categories based on their needs, spending habits, financial condition and other relevant factors.This helps a firm to analyse the requirements of it customer base and along with their interests, lifestyles, priorities and learn their spending habits which can be used to serve different marketing strategies and in planning its customer acquisition and retention plans.This project is going to cover exploratory data analysis on more customers' data sets. So, it helps us to maximise the insight into a dataset and the underlying structure of a dataset while providing all the specific items that an analyst would want to extract from a dataset.To solve this problem, In this project I am going to use clustering analysis.This project uses KNN classification to achieve customer segmentation. After achieving customer segmentation, this can target customers with whom analyst and decision makers can start their marketing strategies.
